## Idea Hub
This is a detailed document that contains all the ideas that we have for the project. It is a living document that will be updated as we come up with new ideas. The purpose of this document is to keep track of all the ideas that we have and to make sure that we are on the same page when it comes to the direction of the project.

### Advantages of building Next.js based Applications
Next.js is a React framework that allows you to build web applications with ease. It provides a lot of features that make it easier to build web applications. Some of the advantages of building Next.js based applications are:
1. **file-based routing**: Next.js uses file-based routing which makes it easier to define the routes of your web application. This makes it easier define instructions on how to create the file structure of the web app when building the actual app.

### Using Tailwind CSS for Styling
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to build web applications with ease. It provides a lot of utility classes that make it easier to style your web applications.

### Using the Wordpress Block Editor (Gutenberg) for Drag and Drop Interface
The idea is to use the Wordpress Block Editor (Gutenberg) as a drag and drop interface to build the web application. We can use the Gutenberg editor to create blocks that represent different components of the web application. Users will be able to drag and drop these blocks to create the web application. This will allow users to build web applications without writing a single line of code.


### Auto-generating the Gutenberg Blocks
The idea is use the fs module in Node.js to read the files pages and components in the Next.js project that was selected as a template. Then use the props and state of the components to generate the Gutenberg blocks. 
The Same Blocks will be used to Modify the pages and components in the Next.js project when The user deploys the project.


### Defining Navigation With No-Code
The idea is to allow users to define the navigation of their web application without writing a single line of code. This will be done by providing a *Node Editor* that will display all the pages of the web application in a tree-like structure. Users will be able to drag and drop pages to create the navigation of their web application. The *Node Editor* will also allow users to define the order of the pages and the hierarchy of the pages. This will allow users to create complex navigation structures without writing a single line of code.
Libraries like [react-flow](https://reactflow.dev/) can be used to implement the *Node Editor*. 


### Using A Modified Next.js Template
The idea is to use a modified Next.js boilerplate template to build the web application. The modified template will contain all the necessary files and folders that are required to build a web application.
Since we will be using **Craft.js** for the drag and drop interface, we will need to modify the template to include the necessary files and folders that are required to build a web application using **Craft.js**.


### Libraries to use as Templates
Some of the libraries that we can use as templates starting point for the project are:
