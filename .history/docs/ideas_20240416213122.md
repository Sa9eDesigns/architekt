## Idea Hub
This is a detailed document that contains all the ideas that we have for the project. It is a living document that will be updated as we come up with new ideas. The purpose of this document is to keep track of all the ideas that we have and to make sure that we are on the same page when it comes to the direction of the project.

### Advantages of building Next.js based Applications
Next.js is a React framework that allows you to build web applications with ease. It provides a lot of features that make it easier to build web applications. Some of the advantages of building Next.js based applications are:
1. **file-based routing**: Next.js uses file-based routing which makes it easier to define the routes of your web application. This makes it easier define instructions on how to create the file structure of the web app when building the actual app.


### Defining Navigation With No-Code
The idea is to allow users to define the navigation of their web application without writing a single line of code. This will be done by providing a *Node Editor* that will display all the pages of the web application in a tree-like structure. Users will be able to drag and drop pages to create the navigation of their web application. The *Node Editor* will also allow users to define the order of the pages and the hierarchy of the pages. This will allow users to create complex navigation structures without writing a single line of code.
Libraries like [react-flow](https://reactflow.dev/) can be used to implement the *Node Editor*.
