# Primitive Elements
Everything that a user can see or interact with in a user interface is a primitive element. UI primitives are the building blocks of a user interface. They are the smallest unit of a user interface that can be manipulated by the user. They are the basic elements that are used to create more complex elements
There are different types of Primitive Elements, such as:
- Typography: Paragraphs, Headings, Lists, etc.
- Form Elements: Input Fields, Buttons, Checkboxes, etc.
- Layout Elements: Grids, Cards, etc.
- Navigation Elements: Menus, Breadcrumbs, etc.
- Media Elements: Images, Videos, etc.
- Interactive Elements: Sliders, Carousels, etc.
- Data Elements: Tables, Charts, etc.
- Feedback Elements: Alerts, Modals, etc.
- Other Elements: Icons, Badges, etc.
Each of these elements has its own set of properties and methods that can be used to manipulate them. For example, a button element might have properties like text, color, size, etc., and methods like onClick, onMouseOver, etc.

# Properties
Properties are the attributes of a primitive element that define its appearance, behavior, and functionality. Properties can be used to customize the appearance of an element, such as its color, size, font, etc. They can also be used to define the behavior of an element, such as its onClick event, onMouseOver event, etc. Properties are the key to customizing and manipulating primitive elements in a user interface.

# Actions
Actions define the behavior of the app in response to user interactions with the app's elements or widgets. Actions can be triggered by user interactions, such as clicking a button, hovering over an element, etc. Actions can also be triggered by external events, such as receiving data from an API, a timer, etc. Actions are the key to creating interactive user interfaces that respond to user input and external events.
